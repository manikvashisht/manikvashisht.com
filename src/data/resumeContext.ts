Manik Vashisht - Senior Software Architect & AI Engineer

SUMMARY:
Seasoned Software Architect and Tech Lead with 14+ years of experience designing scalable, distributed systems for Fortune 500 enterprises. I bridge the gap between robust Cloud-Native Architecture and emerging Artificial Intelligence.
Currently focused on engineering production-grade AI applications, I leverage deep expertise in Java/Spring microservices, GKE, and DevSecOps to build secure, high-performance RAG pipelines and autonomous agentic workflows. Proven track record of managing $5M+ portfolios and leading cross-functional teams through digital transformation.
